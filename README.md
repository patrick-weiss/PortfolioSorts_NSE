# Non-Standard Errors in Portfolio Sorts

This repository contains code for: **"Non-Standard Errors in Portfolio Sorts"** (joint work with [Dominik Walter](https://sites.google.com/view/dominikwalter/startseite) and [RÃ¼diger Weber](https://sites.google.com/site/ruedigercweber/)). 

We share the **full replication** code and an **all-in-one** solution. The later covers all steps from data download to the actual portfolio sorts that embrace NSE by constructing 69,120 return differentials as estimates for the variable *asset growth*. There is a [blog post](https://www.tidy-finance.org/blog/nse-portfolio-sorts/index.html) on the [Tidy Finance Blog](https://www.tidy-finance.org/blog.html) covering this very solution.

The code is open source and available here. Please cite the corresponding paper:

(joint work with Christoph Scheuch and Stefan Voigt).
